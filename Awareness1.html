<h1>WHAT IS AIR POLLUTION ? 
</h1>
<article>
Air pollution can be defined as the contamination of the atmosphere with anomalous concentrations of substances that are harmful to the health of human beings and other organisms. Typical examples of air pollutants include sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, ammonia, chlorofluorocarbons (often abbreviated to CFCs), and methane. Air pollution is a serious environmental concern since it can cause several diseases in human beings, some even resulting in death. Therefore, the prevention of air pollution is very important. Air pollution is also known to have an adverse impact on a wide spectrum of life forms including crops and animals. It can be noted that air pollution can occur due to natural processes or human activity, the latter being more predominant (air pollution caused by human activity is generally referred to as anthropogenic air pollution.

For a variety of pollution-related diseases including heart disease, respiratory infections, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), lung cancer, and stroke, air pollution is known to be a major risk factor. The consequences of poor air quality on human health are far ranging, but primarily affect the respiratory system of the body along with the cardiovascular system. The type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the health status and genetics of the individual, and the degree of exposure determine the individual reactions to air pollutants. Indoor air pollution and low urban air quality are known to be classified as two of the world’s worst toxic pollution problems.

The Supreme Court on Thursday hauled up the Punjab and Haryana governments for not proceeding against farmers indulging in stubble burning, a major cause for pollution and declining air standards in the Delhi-NCR region.

A bench, comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih, also reprimanded the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for not launching a single prosecution against incidents of stubble burning in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas.

The top court observed that Punjab and Haryana have only exacted nominal compensation from farmers found burning stubble.

Quoting the World Health Organisation, the Economic Survey says that 99% of the world breathes air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants.
Focusing on climate adaptation as a key goal, the government in the 2024-25 Economic Survey, tabled in Parliament on Friday (January 31, 2025) said that India will need to continue “efforts to maximise the efficiency of its existing fossil fuel resources in the medium term”. The Survey pointed to developed countries prematurely shutting down thermal power plants without viable alternatives, and said that widespread adoption of renewable energy remains challenging.

The Economic Survey recognises air pollution as a major concern for north India, especially for people in the Delhi NCR region where unhealthy air has almost become a staple in the winter months. In 2024 (until December 27, 2024), Delhi saw 155 days of ‘poor’, ‘very poor’, or ‘severe’ air quality, with an air quality index (AQI) of 200 or more. For the first time in six years, the city did not witness even one day of ‘good’ air quality days (AQI lesser than 50) in 2024.
Even on the day the Economic Survey was tabled in Parliament, the air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category at 9 a.m., with an AQI of 349 — and this was two days after stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was invoked in NCR on January 29, 2025 as the air quality deteriorated.

Quoting the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Economic Survey says that 99% of the world breathes air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, but people in low and middle-income countries suffer the most. The document recognises the role of human activities like vehicular traffic, agricultural practices, and use of coal and wood for cooking, it also puts the blame on geography and wind direction.

The Survey focuses on government programmes like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) and actions like GRAP that have been designed to tackle the problem of air pollution. “The NCAP emphasises the implementation of City Action Plans (CAPs) through the convergence of resources from various central government schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), AMRUT, Smart City Mission, SATAT, and Nagar Van Yojana, as well as through resources from state governments/UT administration and agencies like municipal corporations and urban development authorities,” the Survey states. However, a report published in The Hindu on April 28, 2024 analyses how implementation of Clean Air Action Plans under NCAP has been inconsistent.

“The NCAP was well-intentioned, and a significant sum of money has been allocated. However, as Economic Survey shows, not much progress has been made in Delhi. This is because the NCAP is focused on cities. But air pollution is a truly national phenomenon, with our rural communities also experiencing bad air quality because of sources such as wood, waste, and agricultural residue burning and informal industries (e.g. brick kilns). These emissions from outside the non-attainment cities pollute our villages and contribute to urban air pollution,” R Subramanian, sector head (air quality) at CSTEP told The Hindu.

GRAP is a series of restrictions imposed in response to air pollution levels, but in December 2024, when Delhi NCR was going through yet another bout of air pollution, Supreme Court compared the plan to “medicine given to an already critical patient”, raising doubts on its efficacy.

The Economic Survey says that India’s climate efforts keep the country’s 2070 net-zero emissions target in mind, and climate mitigation and adaptation should be included in its growth strategy to achieve this goal without comprising on economic development.
